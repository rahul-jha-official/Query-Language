# Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
LINQ is a set of technologies that allow simple and efficient querying over different kind of data.
Language Integrated Query allows filtering, ordering and transforming the collection elements, and more.

LINQ can work with other types of collections like databases or XML files (Syntax remains the same).

# Benefit of LINQ
- It allows a simple, efficient, and unified way of querying over different kind of data.
- Queries execute only when result is needed.
- Code written with LINQ is cleaner, more readable and shorter.

# Deferred Execution
- Deferred Execution means that the evaulation of a LINQ expression is delayed until the value is actually needed.
- It allows us to work on the latest data.
- It improves the performance, as the query is materialized only when it's actually needed, so we can avoid unnecessary execution.

# Lambda Expression
Lambda Expression allow us to create anonymous function. In C# we can use function like any other types - store them in variables or pass as parameters.

# Extension Methods
An extension method is a method defined outside of a type, that can be called upon this type's objects as a regular member methods.

Extension Methods allow us to add new functionality to a type without modifying it.

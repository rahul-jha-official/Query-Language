# Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
LINQ is a set of technologies that allow simple and efficient querying over different kind of data.
Language Integrated Query allows filtering, ordering and transforming the collection elements, and more.

LINQ can work with other types of collections like databases or XML files (Syntax remains the same).

# Benefit of LINQ
- It allows a simple, efficient, and unified way of querying over different kind of data.
- Queries execute only when result is needed.
- Code written with LINQ is cleaner, more readable and shorter.

# Deferred Execution
- Deferred Execution means that the evaulation of a LINQ expression is delayed until the value is actually needed.
- It allows us to work on the latest data.
- It improves the performance, as the query is materialized only when it's actually needed, so we can avoid unnecessary execution.
